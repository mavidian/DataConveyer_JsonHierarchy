# DataConveyer_JsonHierarchy

DataConveyer_JsonHierarchy is a console application to demonstate some ways Data Conveyer can be used to
transfor hierarchical JSON data. The application recognizes 3 alternative formats (JSON hierarchies) of the same data
representing population, drivers and vehicles by US state by years:

**Flat Data**
```
[
  {
    "State": "Alabama",
    "Year": "2009",
    "Population": "",
    "Drivers": "3782284",
    "Vehicles": "4610850"
  },
...
```

**Data by Year**
```
[
  {
    "State": "Alabama",
    "DataByYear": [
      {
        "2009": {
          "Population": "",
          "Drivers": "3782284",
          "Vehicles": "4610850"
        }
      },
      {
        "2010": {
          "Population": "4785514",
...
```

**Data by Type**
```
[
  {
    "State": "Alabama",
    "DataByType": [
      {
        "Population": {
          "2009": "",
          "2010": "4785514",
          ...
        }
      },
      {
        "Drivers": {
          "2009": "3782284",
...
```

The files presented on input are expected to be in one of these 3 formats and named with the respective suffixes of
*_FlatData.json*, *_DataByYear.json* and *_DataByType.json*. The application converts such files according to the following scheme:
   
    FlatData   ->  DataByYear
    DataByYear ->  DataByType
    DataByType ->  FlatData

There are sample input files located in the Data subfolder. They contain data on population, drivers and vehicles by US states.
The data was collected from public sources, such as https://www.census.gov/ or https://www.bts.gov/.
